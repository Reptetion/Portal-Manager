<h2>Portal Manager</h2>

<h4>Portal Manager is discord server manager bot specifically designed to assist ReCreate's Portal which is the official support server of <i>ReCreate Discord Bot!</i></h4><br>

<h2>What Does Portal Manager Do?</h2>

<h4>Portal Manager has a bug reporting system which allows users to report bugs in ReCreate and potentially get a badge! This program engages users and motivates them to seek and report bugs. Portal Manager can also answer user' questions by detecting text messages in the chat and responding to potential questions! Without Portal Manager, ReCreate's Portal will be a lot harder to manage.</h4><br>

<h4>This project, along with the <i>ReCreate Discord Bot</i> brand, was discontinued on May 21, 2021.</h4>
